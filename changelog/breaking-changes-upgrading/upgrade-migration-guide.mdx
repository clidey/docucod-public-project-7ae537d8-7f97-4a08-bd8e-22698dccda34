# Upgrade & Migration Guide

Welcome to the Linkwarden Upgrade & Migration Guide, designed specifically to guide you through the process of safely upgrading your Linkwarden installation. This guide delivers clear, step-by-step instructions tailored to users planning their upgrade journey—covering critical aspects such as applying new database migrations, adapting integrations, and updating environment configurations. By following this guide, you ensure a smooth, risk-mitigated transition to newer versions of Linkwarden.

---

## 1. Preparing for the Upgrade

Before beginning your upgrade, it’s essential to back up your current data and environment to prevent data loss in case of unexpected issues.

### Step 1: Backup Current Data
- **Create a full database backup:** Use your database tools (e.g., `pg_dump` for PostgreSQL) to export your current state.
- **Export user data:** Utilize Linkwarden’s export functionality via the API or web interface to create a portable backup.

### Step 2: Review Release Notes and Breaking Changes
- Check the [Breaking Changes & Deprecated Features](https://linkwarden.com/changelog/breaking-changes-upgrading/breaking-changes) page for version-specific upgrade instructions.
- Identify changes impacting collections, links, and integrations.

### Step 3: Verify System Requirements
- Ensure your environment meets the [System Requirements](https://linkwarden.com/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements) for the new version.
- Update dependencies such as Node.js, PostgreSQL, and container images if applicable.

---

## 2. Applying Database Migrations

As part of the upgrade, new database schema migrations are often released. These changes are crucial to ensure compatibility with the new application version.

### Step 1: Prepare Migration Environment
- Stop the Linkwarden web and worker services to prevent data inconsistencies.
- Confirm you have sufficient permissions for schema updates.

### Step 2: Run Database Migrations
- Execute the migration scripts or commands packaged with the upgrade. Typically, this step involves running:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

- Monitor the migration process for errors and review database logs if necessary.

### Step 3: Verify Migration Success
- Confirm that migration tables and columns have updated correctly.
- Optionally, use Linkwarden's API or web interface to verify data integrity.

---

## 3. Updating Environment Configuration

Linkwarden’s newer versions may require or support updated environment variables to enable new features or adjust existing behavior.

### Step 1: Review Environment Variables
- Check the [Environment Configuration](https://linkwarden.com/deployment/production-setup/environment-configuration) documentation for newly introduced or deprecated variables.
- Compare your current `.env` file against the sample `.env.example` provided in the update package.

### Step 2: Modify Configuration Safely
- Add or update variables such as:
  - Import/Export file size limits (`IMPORT_LIMIT`)
  - Feature flags (e.g., AI tagging, archive formats)
  - Security and session settings

- Avoid removing variables unless explicitly instructed in the changelog or breaking changes.

### Step 3: Reload and Validate
- Restart your Linkwarden services after applying the new configuration.
- Monitor logs for warnings or errors related to environment settings.

---

## 4. Adapting Integrations and Imports

Upgrading may affect how data imports are handled or how external integrations function.

### Step 1: Import & Export Compatibility
- Linkwarden supports importing bookmarks and links from formats like Linkwarden JSON, HTML files, Wallabag, Omnivore (ZIP), and Pocket CSV.
- Verify that imports continue functioning as expected after upgrade. The import system relies on [migration formats](https://linkwarden.com/packages/types/global.ts) and import handlers that might receive incremental improvements.

### Step 2: Browser Extensions and API Integrations
- Check for updated versions of browser extensions compatible with the new API.
- Confirm that API tokens and authentication workflows still function without disruption.

### Step 3: Validate RSS and Other Automation
- Review any RSS feed subscriptions or automation workflows to ensure polling intervals and API interactions remain stable.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Upgrade Issues

### Problem: Migration fails or rolls back
- **Check logs** for detailed error messages.
- Ensure no concurrent connections are modifying the database.
- Verify permissions for your database user.

### Problem: Config variables not recognized
- Confirm that you have restarted the service after updating the `.env` file.
- Validate syntax and correct variable naming.

### Problem: Imports fail or result in errors
- Check file formats and sizes—some limits may be enforced via `IMPORT_LIMIT`.
- For Omnivore ZIP imports, ensure the ZIP contents meet expected metadata file structure.
- Consult logs for detailed import failure messages.

### Problem: Unexpected UI behavior or missing features
- Clear browser caches.
- Confirm that the frontend and backend versions are compatible.

<Tip>
If encountering persistent issues, consult the [Breaking Changes & Deprecated Features](https://linkwarden.com/changelog/breaking-changes-upgrading/breaking-changes) and [Release History](https://linkwarden.com/changelog/release-history/version-timeline) for detailed guidance.

## 7. Best Practices for a Smooth Upgrade

- **Plan downtime** during migration phases for minimal user disruption.
- **Back up comprehensively** before every upgrade.
- **Test upgrades** in a staging or testing environment before production deployment.
- **Monitor logs closely** immediately after upgrade.
- Keep all components (web frontend, backend API, workers) synchronized to the same version.
