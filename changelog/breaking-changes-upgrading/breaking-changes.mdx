## Recent Breaking Changes and Deprecations

### Version 1.8.0 (Released 2024-06-15)

- **API Changes:** The `/api/v1/links/batch` endpoint now requires the `X-Linkwarden-Version` header. Older requests without this header will be rejected.
- **Deprecated:** Legacy authentication tokens are no longer accepted. Migrate to OAuth 2.0 or API tokens.
- **Configuration:** The global setting `ALLOW_REGISTRATION` has been renamed to `ENABLE_USER_REGISTRATION`. Update your `.env` accordingly.
- **User Note:** Any custom clients or scripts must update API call headers to avoid authentication errors.

### Version 1.7.2 (Released 2024-03-05)

- **Removed Feature:** Support for importing bookmarks from the `Wallabag JSON v1` format has been removed. Users should export using the newer Wallabag API format.
- **Deprecation:** The `legacyUserProfile` endpoint is deprecated and will be removed in version 1.9.
- **Breaking UI Change:** The ‘Pin to Dashboard’ option was moved from the link actions menu to the bulk actions toolbar. Adjust your workflows accordingly.

### Version 1.7.0 (Released 2024-01-10)

- **Breaking Permission Model Update:** Collection sharing permissions now require explicit READ access to view a collection. Previously shared collections without defined READ permissions will no longer be accessible.
- **Deprecated:** Old webhook endpoints `/api/v1/webhooks/old` are deprecated. Upgrade webhooks to new API versions.
- **Configuration:** The setting `RSS_POLL_INTERVAL` now defaults to 30 minutes if unset, increased from 15 minutes.

## Managing Breaking Changes Effectively

### Practical Tips

- **Backup First:** Always back up your data and configuration before applying updates.

- **Monitor Logs:** Review application logs after upgrading to catch deprecated API usage warnings early.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

## Troubleshooting Breaking Changes

### Issue: API Requests Returning 400 or 401 Errors

- Verify that your API requests include the required headers, such as `X-Linkwarden-Version`.

- Consult the [Authentication & Authorization](https://linkwarden.app/docs/api-reference/core-workflows/authentication-and-authorization) guide for latest practices.

### Issue: Unable to Access Shared Collections

- Confirm that your user role still has explicit READ permission for shared collections.
- Review collection permissions under user administration.
- Review the [Authorization & Permissions](https://linkwarden.app/docs/security/auth-models-identity/authorization-models) documentation.

### Issue: Import Failures for Wallabag Files

- Make sure to export using Wallabag's latest API format.
- Validate file format before import.
- See the [Importing and Exporting Bookmarks](https://linkwarden.app/docs/guides/automation-and-integrations/bulk-import-export) guide for updated instructions.
