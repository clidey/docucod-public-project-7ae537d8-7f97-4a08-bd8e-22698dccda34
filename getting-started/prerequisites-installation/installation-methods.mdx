# Installation Methods

Welcome to Linkwarden! This guide will help you choose the best way to get started based on your needs. Whether you want instant access via our official cloud service or prefer the flexibility and control of self-hosting, this guide walks you through the options for installing the Linkwarden web and mobile apps.

---

## 1. Overview of Installation Options

Linkwarden offers three primary ways to get up and running:

- **Official Cloud Service**: The fastest way to start using Linkwarden with zero setup.
- **Self-Hosting with Docker Compose**: Ideal for users who want a reliable, containerized setup with minimal manual effort.
- **Manual Self-Hosting Deployment**: A more hands-on route for advanced users or specific environment needs.

Additionally, this page covers installation flows for both the **web app** and the **mobile app**.

## 2. Using the Official Cloud Service for Instant Access

The most straightforward way to start is to use Linkwarden's official cloud-hosted service. This lets you sign up, log in, and begin saving and preserving links immediately without worrying about infrastructure or configuration.

### Steps:

1. Navigate to [https://linkwarden.app](https://linkwarden.app).
2. Click **Sign Up** to create a new account using your email address.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to verify your email and log in.
4. Once logged in, you can start adding links, creating collections, and exploring preservation features.

<Tip>
Using the official cloud means no server maintenance, automated backups, and seamless mobile app integration out-of-the-box.
</Tip>

## 3. Self-Hosting Installation Methods

If data sovereignty, customization, or control over your environment is a priority, self-hosting Linkwarden is the ideal choice. We support two main self-hosting methods:

### 3.1 Docker Compose Deployment (Recommended for Most Users)

Docker Compose simplifies running Linkwardenâ€™s backend services and database with a single configuration.

#### Prerequisites:
- Docker and Docker Compose installed (recommended versions: Docker 20.10+, Docker Compose 1.29+).
- A Linux, macOS, or Windows system with minimum required resources (see [System Requirements](../prerequisites-installation/system-requirements)).

#### Step-by-Step:

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the Linkwarden Repository">
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden.git
cd linkwarden
```
</Step>
<Step title="Create Environment Configuration">
Copy the example environment file and customize it:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set database URL, domain, and other settings
```
</Step>
<Step title="Start Docker Compose">
Run the following to launch Linkwarden services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Running Services">
Check container status:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```
You should see web, worker, and database containers running.
</Step>
<Step title="Access Linkwarden Web App">
Open your browser to your configured domain or localhost on port 80/443.
Create the first admin user if prompted.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Make sure your firewall allows access to the ports used by Linkwarden (default HTTP/HTTPS ports).
</Note>

### Troubleshooting:
- If containers fail to start, check logs with:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```
- Verify correct database connectivity string in `.env` file.

---

### 3.2 Manual Deployment (Advanced)

Manual deployment involves setting up and running all necessary components individually, suitable for users who require custom orchestration or environments without Docker.

#### Prerequisites:
- Node.js environment for the backend.
- PostgreSQL database.
- Web server (e.g., Nginx) to serve static frontend assets and handle TLS.

#### Steps Overview:

<Steps>
<Step title="Obtain Source Code">
Clone the repository and checkout the latest main branch:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/linkwarden/linkwarden.git
git checkout main
```
</Step>
<Step title="Set Up Database">
Install and configure PostgreSQL.
Create database and user as specified in your `.env`.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in database URL, domains, and other config.
</Step>
<Step title="Build and Start Backend Services">
Run installation and start commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
</Step>
<Step title="Build and Deploy Web Frontend">
Build static assets:
```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run build
```
Serve the generated `dist` or `build` folder with your web server.
</Step>
<Step title="Configure Proxy and TLS">
Set up Nginx or Apache to proxy requests to the backend and serve static web frontend with HTTPS.
</Step>
<Step title="Launch Mobile App"
(See Mobile App Section below.)

</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Manual deployment requires significant knowledge of Node.js, database management, and web server configuration. Ensure you secure your installation with proper firewall rules, HTTPS, and backups.
</Warning>
