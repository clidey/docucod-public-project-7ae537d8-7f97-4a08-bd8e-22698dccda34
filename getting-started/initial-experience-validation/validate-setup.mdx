# Validating Your Setup

Welcome to the critical final step in your Linkwarden journey: ensuring that everything you’ve installed and configured is working flawlessly. This guide walks you through verifying the core functionalities — logging in, adding bookmarks, reviewing preserved content, and testing search — so you can confidently confirm your system is ready to protect and organize your web knowledge.

---

## 1. Confirm Successful Login

Your first goal is to ensure user authentication works smoothly.

### Steps:

1. Open your Linkwarden web or mobile application.
2. Enter your username and password.
3. Click or tap the **Login** button.

### Success Criteria:
- You land on your dashboard without errors.
- The main dashboard container appears visibly.

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- If login fails, verify your user credentials and server connection.
- Check your environment variables and authentication provider settings as described in the [First Run Setup](../prerequisites-installation/first-run-setup).
- Review server and client logs for authentication errors.

<Note>
If you seeded a default user as part of setup (e.g., through the Playwright seed user script), ensure those credentials match what you use here.
</Note>

## 2. Add a New Bookmark (Link)

Test that bookmarking works and that your instance can capture new content.

### Steps:

1. Navigate to the link addition interface. In the web dashboard, find the 'Add Link' button or similar control.
2. Enter a valid URL (e.g., https://example.com).
3. Optionally, add a name, description, or tags.
4. Submit to save the link.

### Expected Outcome:
- The new bookmark appears in your collection or main links list.
- Automatic preservation (e.g., screenshot, PDF generation) begins in the background.

### Verify Preservation:
- Check the preserved content by opening the saved link details.
- Confirm previews like screenshots or PDFs are available.

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- If the link does not save, check server logs for errors.
- Ensure your preservation workers/services are running.
- Confirm that environmental limits and dependencies are properly configured as per [First Run Setup](../prerequisites-installation/first-run-setup).

## 3. Validate Core Search Functionality

Searching your saved links is essential for retrieval.

### Steps:

1. Locate the search input in the dashboard UI.
2. Type a keyword or tag related to your saved bookmark.
3. Execute the search.

### Success Criteria:
- Relevant bookmarks appear in the results.
- Search is responsive without errors.

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- If no results appear, verify links were saved correctly.
- Confirm the search index is up-to-date.
- Refer to [Smart Tagging and Full-Text Search](../../guides/advanced-tasks-and-best-practices/ai-tagging-search) for indexing configurations.

## 4. Review Logs for Deep Insights

If any step did not complete as expected, the logs provide the data you need to diagnose issues.

### Where to Find Logs:

- **Server Logs**: Check application logs where Linkwarden backend is running.
- **Preservation Worker Logs**: Review logs for workers that handle screenshots, PDFs, and archiving.
- **Client-Side Logs**: Use browser developer tools console or mobile app debug options.

### Common Log Indicators:
- Authentication failures
- Network timeouts
- Preservation service errors
- Search indexing problems

Enable debug or verbose logging during troubleshooting for detailed output.

## Next Steps

Once you've validated your setup:

- Explore adding collections and organizing links ([Collections & Tags Basics](../../guides/getting-started/collections-and-tags-basics)).
- Test sharing and collaboration features if enabled ([Inviting Members and Setting Permissions](../../guides/collaboration-and-sharing/inviting-collaborators)).
- Set up RSS feed subscriptions to automate link saving ([RSS Feed Subscription](../../guides/automation-and-integrations/rss-feed-subscription)).
