# Quickstart: Adding and Preserving Your First Link

Welcome to Linkwarden! This guide will walk you through adding your very first bookmark or webpage, preserving the content automatically as a screenshot and PDF, and organizing it with collections and tags — all using the web or mobile app. You will experience firsthand how Linkwarden solves link rot and helps you keep important web resources accessible and organized.

2. A popup or modal will appear prompting for the link URL.
</Step>
<Step title="Enter the URL">
1. Paste or type the full web address you want to save, for example: `https://example.com`.
2. Ensure the URL starts with `http://` or `https://` for validation.
</Step>
<Step title="Save the Link">
Click **Save to Linkwarden** to add the bookmark.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Via Mobile App

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Add Link Sheet">
1. Tap the **Add Link** button on the main screen (often a floating button or toolbar icon).

</Step>
<Step title="Input Your URL">
Type or paste the complete URL into the input field.
</Step>
<Step title="Store the Link">

## 3. Automatic Content Preservation

Once saved, Linkwarden immediately initiates a preservation process for the link. This includes:

- **Screenshot Capture:** A snapshot of the webpage at the time of saving.
- **PDF Generation:** A complete PDF archive of the page for offline viewing.

This ensures your saved link isn’t just a plain URL but contains a durable snapshot to protect against future changes or disappearances.

<Info>
You do not need to configure anything extra for preservation on first save — it runs automatically in the background.

## 4. Organizing Your Link with Collections and Tags

After saving, organizing your content helps you find and manage links effectively.

### Editing Your Link

You can update the name, URL, description, and assign your link to a collection or tag it.

### On Web

1. Navigate to the newly saved link in your list.
2. Click the **Edit** icon (pencil) next to the link.
3. Modify the details such as:
   - **Name:** Friendly title for easy spotting.
   - **Collection:** Assign it to an existing collection or create a new one.
   - **Tags:** Add one or more tags to categorize.
4. Save your changes.

### On Mobile

1. Tap the link to open its details.
2. Tap the **Edit** button.
3. Change name, URL, description.
4. Tap the collection section to pick or search collections.
5. Add tags if desired.
6. Save to update.

<Tip>
Collections group related links (e.g., "Research", "Courses") while tags are flexible labels (e.g., "AI", "Reference"). Use both for powerful organization.
</Tip>

## 5. Viewing and Using Your Links

With your link saved and preserved, you can:

- Open the preserved snapshot or PDF anytime — even if the original webpage is down.
- Search your collections and tags to promptly find the right resource.
- Share links or collections with team members (if enabled).

Try clicking your first link from the dashboard to see its preview and preserved content.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Invalid URL Error:** Ensure the URL starts with `http://` or `https://`. Avoid partial or malformed addresses.
- **Preservation Delays:** Archiving snapshots and PDFs may take a moment depending on page size and server load. Refresh after a short wait.
- **Link Not Appearing:** Refresh your list or clear any applied filters. Ensure you are logged in with proper permissions.

<Warning>
If saving is disabled, check if you’re on a read-only demo environment. In production, saving is always enabled.
</Warning>
