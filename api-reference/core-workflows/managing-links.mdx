# Managing Links API Reference

Comprehensive documentation for the API endpoints used to create, read, update, delete, and annotate links in Linkwarden. This guide covers individual and bulk operations, request and response examples, and best practices to efficiently associate links with collections, tags, and highlights.

---

## 1. Overview

The Links API provides full control over managing user bookmarks, including:

- Adding new links to collections
- Retrieving links with filtering and sorting
- Updating link properties and metadata
- Deleting single or multiple links
- Managing archival preservation states and annotations

All endpoints require authenticated user context and appropriate permissions on the collections.

---

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

The API enforces user authentication via session tokens or API keys as described in the [Authentication & Authorization](https://linkwarden.app/api-reference/core-workflows/authentication-and-authorization) documentation. 

### Permission Model

- Users must own or have delegated permissions in collections to create, update, or delete links.
- Viewing a link requires read access to the collection.
- Archival actions depend on ownership or explicit "canUpdate" rights.

Unauthorized actions return `401 Unauthorized` errors.

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- **Duplicate Prevention:** Enable and respect duplicate link prevention settings to avoid clutter.
- **Batch Processing:** Use bulk endpoints to efficiently modify or delete multiple links instead of repeating single requests.
- **Permission Checks:** Always verify if the user has adequate rights before invoking create, update, or delete operations.
- **Archival Refresh:** Regularly refresh preservation data for important links to ensure archival snapshots remain up-to-date.
- **Error Handling:** Handle HTTP 401 responses to prompt re-authentication. Review error messages for common issues like invalid URLs or file types.

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue                                 | Cause                                             | Solution                                                      |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 401 Unauthorized                     | Missing or invalid auth token; insufficient permissions | Ensure valid token; confirm collection access permissions      |
| 400 Bad Request on create/update     | Duplicate link or invalid input                    | Check data validity; avoid duplicate URLs                      |
| Archival upload fails                | File rejection due to unsupported format or too large | Confirm file format and size limits (e.g., max 10 MB)           |
| Link not found                      | Link ID does not exist or link was deleted        | Verify link ID correctness, existence                          |

For detailed errors, inspect API JSON responses for `response` fields.
