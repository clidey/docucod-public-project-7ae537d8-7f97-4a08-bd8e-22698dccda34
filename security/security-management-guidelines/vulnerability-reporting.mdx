# Vulnerability Reporting & Responsible Disclosure

Ensuring the security of all users is a top priority. If you discover a potential security issue or vulnerability in Linkwarden, this guide provides clear steps on how to responsibly report it. Following this process helps protect users by enabling timely mitigation while maintaining discretion.

---

## 1. Overview of Responsible Disclosure

Responsible disclosure is the ethical approach to reporting security vulnerabilities. It involves confidentially sharing your findings with the project team, allowing time for investigation and remediation before public disclosure.

By adhering to this process, you help maintain trust in the platform and avoid exploitation risks.

## 2. How to Report a Vulnerability

If you identify a security weakness or breach, follow these steps:

1. **Document the Issue Clearly**
   - Describe the vulnerability succinctly.
   - Include steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Provide any relevant evidence such as screenshots, logs, or code snippets.

2. **Report Confidentially**
   - Contact the security team directly via the designated email address: `security@linkwarden.com`.
   - Use encrypted communication methods when possible (e.g., PGP/GPG).

3. **Avoid Public Disclosure**
   - Do not share or publish the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.
   - This precaution prevents malicious actors from exploiting the issue prematurely.

4. **Cooperate and Respond**
   - The security team may request additional information or clarification.
   - Timely collaboration accelerates resolution.

## 3. What to Include in Your Report

To help the team assess and resolve the issue effectively, include:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Environment details (e.g., Linkwarden version, deployment type).
- Steps to reproduce the problem.
- Impact assessment: potential risks and affected components.
- Any suggested mitigations if known.

---

## 4. What Happens After You Report

After receipt, the security team will:

- Acknowledge your report within 2 business days.
- Perform a thorough analysis and risk evaluation.
- Prioritize and plan a fix or mitigation.
- Coordinate with you on disclosure and timelines.

Once resolved, a public advisory or release notes entry may be issued communicating the fix without exposing details that aid exploitation.

---

## 5. Reporting Urgent or Critical Vulnerabilities

If you discover a critical vulnerability that may actively harm users or services, mark your communication clearly as `URGENT` in the subject line.

In such rare cases, the team prioritizes immediate investigation and may reach out directly via phone or alternate secure channels for rapid response.

---

## 6. Security Contact Information

- **Security Email**: `security@linkwarden.com`
- **PGP Key**: Available on the official Linkwarden website for encrypted reports

Please use the above contact for all vulnerability disclosures. Avoid reporting issues through public channels like GitHub issues, discussion forums, or social media.

## 7. Reporting Best Practices and Tips

- Test your findings with non-production environments when possible.
- Clearly differentiate between security issues and general bugs.
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond necessary proof-of-concept.
- Respect user privacy and do not disclose sensitive data.

---

## 8. Summary

By participating in the responsible disclosure process, you play a vital role in safeguarding the Linkwarden ecosystem and its users. Your vigilance and cooperation enable the continuous delivery of a secure and trustworthy product.
