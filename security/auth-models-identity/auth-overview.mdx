# Authentication Overview

Linkwarden provides a secure, flexible authentication framework to establish user identities and manage access efficiently across both individual and enterprise deployments. This guide introduces the supported authentication methods—ranging from traditional email/password login to OAuth-based external providers and Single Sign-On (SSO)—and explains how Linkwarden leverages modern protocols to power these workflows. Understanding these methods empowers users and administrators to choose the best approach for their security and usability needs.

## 1. Authentication Methods Supported

Linkwarden supports multiple user authentication mechanisms tailored to different operational contexts, providing seamless user experiences while maintaining robust security.

### 1.1 Email and Password Authentication

- **Description**: Users can sign in using their username or email coupled with a password.
- **Verification**: Email verification is enforced to confirm valid user email ownership.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed securely before storage. Failed credential attempts provide clear, security-conscious error messages.

#### User Sign-In Flow:
1. User enters username/email and password on the login page.
2. System verifies credentials and confirms email is verified.
3. Upon success, a session token is generated (see Session Establishment).
4. On failure, users receive an actionable error message, including a prompt for email verification if required.

### 1.2 OAuth Providers and Third-Party Integration

Linkwarden integrates with a comprehensive list of OAuth-compatible providers to streamline login:

- Popular providers include Google, GitHub, Facebook, Apple, Azure AD, Okta, and many more.
- Administrators enable/disable providers via environment configuration.
- User profile information from the provider (e.g., username, email, profile picture) is linked to the Linkwarden user identity.

#### Key Points:
- **Account Linking**: If a user previously registered via password login and then uses SSO with the same email, Linkwarden links the external account accordingly.
- **Disabling New SSO Users**: Registration via SSO can be restricted in enterprise setups.
- **Email Verification**: SSO users typically have their email automatically verified if trusted.

### 1.3 Single Sign-On (SSO) in Enterprise and Self-Hosted Environments

- Linkwarden supports enterprise-grade SSO protocols to integrate with existing identity infrastructures.
- SSO providers can be configured using OpenID Connect or OAuth2 via supported environment variables.
- User provisioning can be either dynamic or manual, with options to restrict new SSO user creation.

<Note>
Administrators managing enterprise or self-hosted instances should evaluate deployment-specific SSO configuration guides for secure integration.
</Note>

## 2. User Identity Establishment and Verification

Linkwarden authenticates users securely and ensures that identity information is consistent and verified.

### 2.1 User Lookup and Credentials Verification

- Username or email serves as the login identifier.
- The password is hashed and compared securely.
- If email verification is enabled, unverified users are prompted to verify their email before gaining access.

### 2.2 Token Generation and Session Establishment

Upon successful authentication, Linkwarden issues a JSON Web Token (JWT) representing the authenticated session.

- **Token Lifespan**: Tokens have long expiration periods by default (e.g., 30 days for JWT sessions), but tokens can be revoked or refreshed as needed.
- **Session Tokens**: Stored and tracked server-side in an `accessToken` store with metadata for audit and revocation.
- **Revocation Support**: Tokens can be revoked, invalidating sessions immediately.

#### Example: Session Creation Workflow

```text
User authenticated with credentials -> createSession() generates JWT -> JWT contains user ID, issued-at, expiry, and unique token ID (jti) -> JWT saved in Access Tokens database with expiration and session metadata -> JWT returned to user client for use in authenticated requests
```

### 2.3 Session Validation

- Every API request is validated against the JWT for authenticity.
- The system checks token expiry and revocation status before granting access.
- Expired or revoked tokens cause rejection and require re-authentication.

<Warning>
If a session token is detected as revoked or expired, users will be asked to sign in again to ensure account security.
</Warning>

## 3. Login User Interface Experience

Linkwarden’s login page is designed to handle multiple authentication methods transparently and provide clear, helpful feedback.

### 3.1 Credential Login UI

- Prompts for username/email and password entry.
- Optionally shows a "forgot password" link when email login is enabled.
- Supports demo accounts with pre-filled credentials and a one-click sign-in for demonstration environments.

### 3.2 External OAuth and SSO Buttons

- Dynamically displays login buttons for enabled external providers.
- Button clicks initiate respective OAuth flows seamlessly.

### 3.3 Registration Access

- If registration is enabled, users see clear signup links.
- Administrators can disable registration in locked environments.

<Info>
User experience prioritizes minimal friction without compromising security, balancing multiple authentication options within a unified form.

## 4. Security Best Practices for Authentication

To maximize security across login workflows, consider these recommendations:

- **Enforce Email Verification**: Prevent unverified accounts from accessing the system.
- **Secure Password Storage**: Use strong hashing (e.g., bcrypt) to protect passwords.
- **Rate Limit Login Attempts**: Apply throttling or CAPTCHA mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Use HTTPS/TLS Everywhere**: Protect all authentication data in transit.
- **Manage Session Lifetimes**: Limit session validity and support explicit logout and token revocation.
- **Enable MFA via SSO Providers**: When possible, leverage multi-factor authentication from external identity providers.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Authentication Issues

### 5.1 Invalid Credentials
- Confirm username or email is correct and properly cased.
- Reset password using the "forgot password" flow if unsure.

### 5.2 Email Not Verified
- Check your user email inbox (including spam) for verification messages.
- Follow the verification link or request a new verification email.
- Contact administrator if email verification is disabled or broken.

### 5.3 Session Expired or Revoked
- Log out and log in again to obtain a new session token.
- If persistent, check with administrators about account or token status.

### 5.4 OAuth Provider Errors
- Ensure third-party OAuth providers are configured correctly.
- Verify environment variables and callback URLs.
- Clear browser cookies/cache or try incognito mode.

If issues persist, consult deployment and environment configuration guides relevant to your Linkwarden installation.

## 6. Additional Technical Notes

- Linkwarden uses the NextAuth.js framework for managing authentication flows internally.
- Providers can be dynamically enabled or disabled through environment variables for flexible deployment.
- Tokens are securely generated with cryptographically random UUIDs for JWT IDs.
- The Prisma ORM manages user and token persistence to ensure robust data integrity.
