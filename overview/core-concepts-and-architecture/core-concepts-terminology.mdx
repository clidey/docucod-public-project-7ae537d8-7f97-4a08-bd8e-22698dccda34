# Core Concepts & Terminology

## Introduction

Welcome to the foundational guide that explains the essential terminology and concepts you'll encounter as you use Linkwarden. This page is your compass to understanding how the product works from the user’s perspective—what each term means, why it matters, and how it affects your daily workflows.

## Key Terms Explained

### Link
A *Link* in Linkwarden is any web address (URL) you save for future reference. It could be a simple website URL, a PDF, or an image. Saving links preserves access to important content that you want to revisit or share.

- Links can be enriched with titles, descriptions, and tags to improve organization and searchability.
- You can preserve links by archiving their content to prevent loss from site changes or removal.

### Collection
Think of a *Collection* as a folder or library where you group related links together. Collections help you organize your links logically by topics, projects, or any theme that matters to you.

- Collections have names and optional descriptions.
- You can assign colors and icons to visually distinguish collections.
- Collections support collaboration: you can share them and assign permissions to team members.

### Preservation
*Preservation* refers to saving not just the link but also the content behind it—such as the webpage snapshot, PDF, or readable version—to guard against link rot and content loss.

- This ensures you have permanent offline access.
- Preservation supports formats like screenshots, PDFs, readable HTML, or even Wayback Machine archival.

### Highlights
*Highlights* allow you to emphasize important parts of saved links. You can select text on a preserved webpage and add comments or color-coded highlights.

- This is great for marking key points in research articles or essential content you want to revisit quickly.

### Tag
*Tags* are keywords or labels you assign to links or collections to categorize and enhance search.

- Tags can be created freely or suggested through AI tagging methods.
- They work like metadata to filter and find links faster.

### RSS Subscription
An *RSS Subscription* enables you to automatically pull in new web content from favorite sites or blogs.

- Subscribed feeds can be assigned to collections.
- This automation keeps you updated without manual saving.

### Archival Formats
These define the way content is preserved for each saved link. Linkwarden supports multiple formats:

- **Screenshot:** A visual capture of the webpage as an image.
- **PDF:** A document format preserving page layout.
- **Readable:** A cleaned, text-focused version for easy reading.
- **Monolith:** A single HTML file with embedded assets.
- **Wayback Machine:** Preservation using the external archival service.

Choosing the right format depends on your use case—for example, PDFs are perfect for formal report sharing, while readable views help on-the-go skimming.

### User Roles
In collaborative settings, *User Roles* determine what actions each individual can perform:

- Roles include permissions like create, update, delete within collections or links.
- Roles enable secure collaboration while protecting sensitive data.
