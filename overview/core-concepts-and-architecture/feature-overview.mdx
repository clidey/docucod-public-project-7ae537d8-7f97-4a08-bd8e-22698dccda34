## Core Features & How They Fit in Your Workflow

### 1. Automated Web Content Preservation

Linkwarden automatically captures and archives content when you save a link, ensuring you can revisit the exact page even if the original goes offline or changes. Preservation modes include full-page archiving and customizable snapshot formats to suit your needs. 

*Scenario:* Imagine bookmarking a research article or tutorial today and confidently accessing its full content months or years later without worrying about broken links or paywalls.

### 2. Collaborative Organizing with Collections and Tags

Group saved links into thematic collections that serve as shared knowledge bases or project folders. Use tags — including AI-generated smart tags — to classify links dynamically and enhance discovery.

*Example:* Your team curates a "Project Alpha" collection with research papers, news updates, and relevant blogs, all easily searched and filtered using tags like "AI," "data analysis," or "strategies."

### 3. Reader and Annotation Modes

Enjoy distraction-free reading inside Linkwarden’s reader view, stripping away clutter from saved pages. Annotate key insights directly on preserved pages to highlight important points and collaborate asynchronously.

*Tip:* When reviewing lengthy documents, use annotations to flag critical sections for your team or for future reference.

### 4. Sharing and Access Controls

Easily share collections or individual links publicly or privately. Configure granular permissions to control collaborator roles—allowing specific users to create, update, or delete content.

*Use Case:* An educator shares a curated reading list with students, enabling them to add comments but restricting editing rights, maintaining content integrity.

### 5. Powerful Search with Bulk Operations

Navigate your growing library with full-text search and filters by date, tag, collection, or preservation status. Perform bulk actions like tagging, archiving, or deleting multiple links to maintain an organized workspace.

*Scenario:* Quickly locate all saved links tagged "mindfulness" and perform batch archive updates as new content becomes available.

### 6. AI Tagging and Metadata Enrichment

Let Linkwarden’s AI analyze saved links to generate context-aware tags, boosting discovery and reducing manual effort. This feature helps reveal implicit themes and relationships across your content.

### 7. Integrations: SSO, Browser Extensions, and RSS

Linkwarden connects smoothly with your existing tools:

- **SSO Integration:** Access Linkwarden securely using your organization’s identity provider.
- **Browser Extensions:** Save links and preserve content directly from your browser without switching context.
- **RSS Feed Subscription:** Automate link saving by subscribing to RSS feeds from favorite sites, keeping you updated effortlessly.

*Practical Tip:* Combine RSS feeds with collections to auto-organize incoming content for research or news monitoring.
