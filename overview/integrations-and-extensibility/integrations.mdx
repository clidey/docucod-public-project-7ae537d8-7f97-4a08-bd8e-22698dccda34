## Secure Authentication & SSO Integration Details

Linkwarden supports extensive OAuth 2.0-based SSO providers out of the box. Environment variables enable or disable providers, including Configurable OAuth providers such as Google, Auth0, GitHub, Azure AD, Keycloak, Apple, and many others.

- During sign-in, user accounts are linked to their social identities for streamlined access.
- Admins can disable new registrations via SSO to control access.
- Email verification workflows integrate with underlying email infrastructure to secure accounts.

This flexible architecture supports organizational policies and improves user onboarding experience while maintaining high security standards.

## Importing & Exporting Bookmarks

### Importing

- Import bookmarks and link collections from supported external platforms via file upload or API.
- Supported formats include:
  - Linkwarden's native export format
  - HTML bookmark files from browsers
  - Wallabag and Pocket exports
- The system automatically maps imported links to collections, tags, and metadata.

### Exporting

- Export your Linkwarden data for backup or migration.
- Select formats that best suit your target platform.

> _Best Practice:_ Regularly export your data to ensure you have a backup outside the platform and to facilitate migration if needed.

## Practical Integration Scenarios

1. **Seamless Login with Corporate Credentials:** Users join using their Google or Azure AD accounts, eliminating password hassles and integrating with existing IT policies.

2. **Automated Research Feed Aggregation:** Researchers subscribe to topic-specific RSS feeds, automatically populating collections with up-to-date articles.

3. **Browser Extension Workflow:** Content creators quickly save links and add tags as they browse, reducing friction and improving recall.

4. **Custom Sync from External Tools:** Developers integrate Linkwarden with internal knowledge management systems via the API to keep link databases synchronized.

5. **Bulk Import for New Team Onboarding:** Admins import existing bookmarks in bulk to get new members started quickly.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **SSO Registration Disabled:** If you’re unable to register with an SSO provider, check if your administrator has disabled new SSO user registrations.
- **Email Integration Issues:** Verify that environment variables for email sending are correctly configured for verification email flows.
- **API Access Denied:** Ensure you have valid API tokens and appropriate permissions to perform requested operations.
- **Too Many Verification Request Errors:** Email providers limit rapid verification attempts. Wait at least 5 minutes before retrying.
- **Missing External Provider:** Confirm environment variables are set and the provider is enabled in the deployment settings.
