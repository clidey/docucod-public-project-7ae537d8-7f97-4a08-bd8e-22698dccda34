## What Is Linkwarden?

Linkwarden is an advanced web bookmarking and knowledge management system designed for the modern internet age. It goes beyond simple link saving by providing tools to preserve, organize, and enrich your links, turning fragmented bookmarks into a living knowledge repository.

Linkwarden solves the problem of ephemeral web content — the common frustration when bookmarked pages break, move, or vanish. It empowers users to maintain access to valuable resources through content preservation and enhanced metadata.

### What Makes Linkwarden Unique?
- **Content Preservation:** Automatically archive web pages as screenshots, readable articles, PDFs, and more to guarantee you can revisit content even if the original is gone.
- **Rich Metadata & Tagging:** Organize your bookmarks deeply through tags, collections, and pinned statuses, enabling smarter retrieval.
- **Collaborative Collections:** Share collections with controlled access, making it easy to build and maintain group knowledge bases.
- **AI-Enhanced Tagging & Search:** Incorporate AI-driven tags and a powerful search engine for lightning-fast discovery beyond simple URL matching.

### How Linkwarden Works at a High Level

Linkwarden centers around "links" which represent your saved URLs enriched with metadata, tags, and archival copies.

When you save a link, the system not only stores the URL but can also archive the page content in formats that withstand internet changes. These links live inside collections—a way to group and collaborate by themes or teams. Tags add another layer of semantic organization, helping you filter and find links based on topics or importance.

The interface is designed with usability in mind, supporting easy addition, editing, and exploration of your link database through sorting, searching, and bulk operations.
