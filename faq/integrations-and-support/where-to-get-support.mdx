## 2. Reporting Bugs and Feature Requests

To help us improve Linkwarden effectively, report bugs and request features through the proper channels:

### GitHub Issue Tracker

- **Include Environment Details:** Platform (web, mobile), version, browser or OS, and any relevant configurations.
- **Attach Logs or Screenshots:** Helps diagnose and resolve issues faster.

### When to Use GitHub vs. Other Channels

## 3. Using Community Resources

Besides official channels, you can leverage the community for peer support:

- **Community Forums:** Certain hosted or third-party forums where users share tips.
- **Social Media:** Follow Linkwarden on platforms for announcements and discussions.
- **Open Source Contributions:** Join the project on GitHub—whether reporting issues, suggesting improvements, or contributing code.

Community channels complement official support but vary in responsiveness and scope.
