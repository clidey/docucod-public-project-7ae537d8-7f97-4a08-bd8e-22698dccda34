## 1. Common Login Problems and Solutions

### 1.1 Invalid Credentials
- **Problem:** You receive an error message indicating "Invalid credentials" after entering your username/email and password.
- **Why It Happens:** This usually means either the username/email or the password you entered is incorrect.
- **How to Fix:**
  1. Double-check that your username or email is correct, including letter case.
  2. Ensure you have the latest password. If uncertain, use the **Forgot Password** link to reset.
  3. If you are sure your credentials are correct but still can't log in, try resetting your password.

### 1.2 Email Not Verified
- **Problem:** You see the error "Email not verified." when attempting to log in with credentials.
- **Why It Happens:** Your email address on file has not been verified yet.
- **How to Fix:**
  1. After this error, Linkwarden automatically sends a new verification email.
  2. Check your inbox (and spam/junk folders) for the verification link.
  3. Complete the email verification by clicking the link.
  4. Once verified, try logging in again.

### 1.3 Forgot Password? How to Reset
- Use the **Forgot Password** link on the login page.
- Enter your registered email or username.

## 2. Single Sign-On (SSO) and External Authentication

### 2.1 Supported SSO Providers
- Linkwarden supports a broad range of SSO/OAuth providers including Google, Apple, GitHub, Microsoft Azure AD, Okta, and many others.

### 2.2 Issues Logging In With SSO
- **New SSO User Registration Disabled:** Some deployments disable new user registration via SSO. If you cannot register, check with your admin.
- **Account Linking:** If your email exists but no linked SSO account is found, Linkwarden attempts to link your SSO provider automatically.

### 2.3 Troubleshooting Tips
- Verify your SSO provider credentials independently.
- Clear your browser cache and try logging in again.
- Contact your administrator if the issue persists, as it may be caused by server-side settings or access restrictions.

## 3. Session and Token Issues

### 3.1 Session Expired or Invalidated
- Sessions utilize secure JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with expiration.
- If your session expires, you may be logged out automatically.
- Simply log in again to establish a new session.

### 3.2 Token Revocation
- If your session or API token has been revoked by an administrator, you will no longer be able to authenticate using that token.
- Contact your administrator to restore access or generate a new token.
