# What is Linkwarden and What Can It Do?

Linkwarden is an open-source, collaborative bookmark manager designed to solve a common and critical problem faced by anyone who wants persistent access to web content: **link rot**. Over time, links can break or web pages can change, causing valuable resources to disappear. Linkwarden ensures your important bookmarks remain accessible and organized, while empowering teams and individuals to collaborate, annotate, and preserve web content seamlessly.

## The Core Purpose of Linkwarden

Imagine discovering months or years later that all your saved links no longer work, or the content you trusted has changed or vanished. This is link rot — a frustrating reality for researchers, educators, content managers, and knowledge workers alike. Linkwarden stops this by automatically capturing, preserving, and enhancing saved web pages beyond a simple URL.

## What Makes Linkwarden Stand Out?

### 1. **Web Page Preservation and Archiving**
Linkwarden doesn't just save URLs; it archives content in multiple formats, so you still have access even if the original page goes offline or changes:

- **Screenshots & PDFs:** Visual snapshots that look just like the original page.
- **Reader View (Clean Content):** Distraction-free, readable versions extracted from pages.
- **Monolith HTML:** Self-contained HTML copies that can be viewed offline.
- **Wayback Machine Integration:** Links to the Internet Archive’s snapshots for an added layer of preservation.

This means no matter how fragile the web becomes, your saved content remains intact and accessible.

### 2. **Collaborative Bookmark Management**
Linkwarden supports powerful teamwork features:

- **Collections and Sub-Collections:** Organize bookmarks hierarchically to match your projects and interests.
- **Shared Collections with Permissions:** Collaborate securely by inviting others with granular access controls.
- **Tagging & AI-Powered Smart Tags:** Add multiple tags to links and enhance discovery with automatic AI-generated tags.

Teams can effortlessly build shared knowledge bases where everyone contributes and finds resources fast.

### 3. **Annotations & Highlights**
Capture your insights and make your saved links more useful by:

- Adding annotations and highlights directly on preserved web pages.
- Easily revisiting your notes during research, content curation, or team discussions.

### 4. **Robust Search & Filtering**
Find what you need instantly:

- Search full-text across saved links and their preserved content.
- Filter results by collection, tags, date added, and other metadata.

### 5. **Open-Source with Self-Hosting Option**
Unlike many proprietary bookmark managers, Linkwarden offers:

- Complete control over your data by self-hosting.
- Transparent development allowing community contributions and customization.
