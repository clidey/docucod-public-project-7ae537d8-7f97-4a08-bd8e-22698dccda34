# How Do I Get Started with Linkwarden?

Welcome to Linkwarden! This guide equips you with the quickest, most effective ways to start accessing and using Linkwarden—whether you prefer the cloud, self-hosting, or trying a demo—and walks you through the essential first steps to get your bookmarks organized, preserved, and ready for productivity.

---

## 1. Choose Your Access Method

### Cloud Hosted Service
The fastest way to get started is with the official Linkwarden cloud service at [https://cloud.linkwarden.app](https://cloud.linkwarden.app). Simply create an account, log in, and begin saving your links immediately without any setup overhead.

### Self-Hosting Linkwarden
If you prefer full control and data sovereignty, deploy Linkwarden on your own infrastructure. Supported environments include Docker containers, Kubernetes clusters, or traditional server installations. After deployment, you can access your self-hosted Linkwarden instance via your custom URL.

For detailed deployment information, see [Getting Started with Deployment](https://docs.linkwarden.app/deployment/production-setup/deployment-getting-started).

### Demo Environment
Unsure where to start or want to explore? Use the public demo environment to experiment freely and understand Linkwarden’s features before committing.


<Tip>
If you are new, we recommend starting with the cloud service to experience Linkwarden’s core capabilities without setup delays.

## 2. Create Your Account and Sign In

Once you've selected your access method:

- **Sign up** by providing a valid email address and setting a strong password.
- For self-hosted setups, ensure your system administrator has configured user registration and authentication correctly.
- After signing up, **log in** to your account to access your personal dashboard.

<Linkwarden supports a variety of authentication methods**, including email/password and SSO providers (in enterprise environments). For more on authentication, see [Authentication Overview](https://docs.linkwarden.app/security/auth-models-identity/auth-overview).

## 3. Your First Important Actions

### Add Your First Links
Start by saving your first bookmarks:

- Use the web app or mobile apps to add URLs.
- Leverage Linkwarden’s browser extension or Progressive Web App on desktop for instant saving.
- When you add a link, Linkwarden automatically preserves a screenshot and PDF copy, protecting against link rot.

Refer to the [Quickstart: Adding and Preserving Your First Link](https://docs.linkwarden.app/getting-started/initial-experience-validation/quickstart-adding-links) guide for detailed workflows.

### Organize with Collections
Collections let you group related links logically:

- Create collections by topic, project, or workflow.
- Nest collections and add descriptions to maintain clarity.
- Assign links to multiple collections as needed.

See [Organizing Links: Collections & Tags](https://docs.linkwarden.app/guides/getting-started/collections-and-tags-basics) for practical advice on structuring your saved links.

### Import Existing Bookmarks
If you have existing bookmarks in browsers or other services, import them via Linkwarden’s bulk import feature to consolidate your resources.

Check the [Importing and Exporting Bookmarks](https://docs.linkwarden.app/guides/automation-and-integrations/bulk-import-export) for supported formats and step-by-step instructions.
