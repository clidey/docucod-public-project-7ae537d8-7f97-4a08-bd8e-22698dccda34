## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Selecting Links in Bulk

- Navigate to your Links library view.
- Use the bulk select checkbox next to each link to select multiple items.
- To select a range quickly, hold the `Shift` key and click the first and last items in the desired range.
  
<Tip>
Using `Shift` + click speeds up selecting many consecutive links without clicking each one individually.
</Tip>

- Verify selected items appear highlighted or counted in the interface.

### 2. Performing Bulk Deletes

- With links selected, click the bulk delete option/button.
- You will see a confirmation modal detailing how many links will be deleted.
- Read the warning carefully; deletions are irreversible.

```plaintext
Warning: Deleting links is permanent and cannot be undone.
```

- Confirm deletion by clicking the "Delete" button.

**Expected Result:**
- Selected links are removed from your library.
- The selection resets automatically.

### 3. Bulk Tagging and Updating

- After selecting multiple links, open the bulk edit interface.
- You can add tags, remove existing tags, or change the collection for the selected links.

<Tip>
Choose to remove previous tags only if you want to replace _all_ tags; otherwise, new tags will be appended to existing ones.
</Tip>

- Confirm changes to apply updates across all selected links.

**Expected Result:**
- Tags and collection assignments update on all selected links.
- Your library view refreshes to reflect changes.

### 4. Tips to Avoid Common Pitfalls

- Ensure you have permission to modify or delete links in the target collections, or you will receive a "Permission denied" error.
- Double-check selections before deleting, especially when handling large batches.
- Keep in mind demo mode disables bulk operations.
- Use pagination or search filters to narrow down your link list for more controlled bulk editing.

### 5. Verification

- Confirm the absence of deleted links in your library.
- Check that intended tags or collections are correctly applied.
- Refresh the page if necessary to ensure the UI reflects backend changes.

You clear clutter while preserving important entries.

### Scenario: Reorganizing Links into a New Collection

You efficiently regroup and tag relevant links for easier retrieval.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Bulk Delete Fails with Permission Errors">
Check that you have deletion rights on all collections containing the selected links. Bulk deletion requires deletion permission on every link’s collection.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Selected Links Do Not Update Tags">
Make sure you confirm the bulk edit action and verify connectivity. Refresh the page to ensure updates are reflected.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Accidentally Deleted Important Links">
Currently, deleted links cannot be recovered. Always double-check your bulk selections before confirming deletions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Utilize filters and sorting to narrow down your selection scope, reducing mistakes and improving bulk operation speed.
</Tip>

## Additional Tips for Large Collections
