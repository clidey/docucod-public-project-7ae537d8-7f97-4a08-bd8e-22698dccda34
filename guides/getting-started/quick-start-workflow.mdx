## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues

- **Cannot Log In**
  - Verify your username and password.
  - Ensure you are using the correct Linkwarden instance URL.
  - Try resetting your password if needed.

- **Link Fails to Save**
  - Double-check the URL format (include https://).
  - Check your internet connection.
  - If the domain is blocked or inaccessible, preservation might fail.

- **Preserved Screenshots or PDFs Not Showing**
  - Preservation processes may take a few moments. Refresh or check back shortly.
  - Some websites block snapshotting; in such cases, preservation is limited.

### Best Practices
- Always verify saved links immediately after addition to catch errors.
- Use meaningful names and descriptions to enhance link management.
- Gradually build collections and tags to improve organization.

### Performance Notes
- Bulk link saving may slow preservation; save links individually when starting out.
