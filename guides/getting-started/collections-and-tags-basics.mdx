# Organizing Links: Collections & Tags

Efficient link organization is essential to maximize the value of your saved web content. This guide explains how to create and manage **collections** and **sub-collections**, add clear descriptions, and assign multiple tags to your links. You will learn strategies for organizing your content hierarchically and thematically, enabling quick retrieval and long-term maintainability.

## 1. Understanding Collections and Tags

### What are Collections?
Collections are user-defined groupings for your links. Think of them as folders or topics where you store related links together. Collections can have **sub-collections** allowing you to organize your bookmarks with nested hierarchies suited to your needs.

### What are Tags?
Tags are flexible labels that you can assign to links across collections. Unlike collections, tags are not hierarchical but help in cross-cutting organization — for example, marking links with topics such as "research", "read-later", or "project-x".

### Why Use Both?
- **Collections** provide a primary structural hierarchy.
- **Tags** create overlapping dimensions to classify and filter links.

Combining both allows you to categorize links effectively by project, topic, status, or any other attribute.

## 2. Prerequisites

- You must be **logged in** to your Linkwarden account.
- Have access to the **Collections page** in either web or mobile app.
- Basic familiarity with adding and editing links.

---

## 3. Creating Collections and Sub-Collections

### Step 1: Access Collections
Navigate to the collections management area in your app. On the web, click the 'Collections' menu; on mobile, open the Collections section from the main menu.

### Step 2: Create a New Collection
- Click or tap **Create New Collection**.
- Enter a clear, descriptive **name** that reflects the purpose of the collection.
- Optionally, choose a **color** to visually identify it.
- Add an optional **description** to provide context.

### Step 3: Create Sub-Collections
- While editing or creating a collection, there is an option to assign a **parent collection**.
- Select an existing collection as the parent to nest your new collection as a sub-collection.

### Step 4: Save Your Collection
- Confirm and save your collection.
- Newly created collections will appear hierarchically in the collections list.

#### Example:
```json
{
  "name": "Research Articles",
  "description": "Collections of academic and industry insights",
  "parentId": 12,  // This links it as a sub-collection under collection with ID 12
  "color": "blue"
}
```

<Note>
Sub-collections inherit visibility and sharing permissions consistent with their parent collection, so review permissions accordingly.
</Note>

## 4. Adding Descriptions to Collections and Links

Adding context through descriptions helps recall why a collection or link matters, especially over time.

### How to Add/Edit Descriptions:
- When creating or editing a collection, find the **Description** field and enter meaningful details.
- For individual links, open the link editor and add notes or summaries in the description box.

### Best Practices:
- Keep descriptions concise but informative.
- Use keywords or project identifiers to improve searchability.

## 5. Assigning Multiple Tags to Your Links

### Why Multiple Tags?
Tags let you slice your saved content in versatile ways. Assigning multiple tags can mark a link for:
- Topic
- Priority
- Status
- Associated project

### How to Add Tags:
- When adding or editing a link, locate the **Tags** section.
- Type to add existing tags or create new ones on the fly.
- You can assign multiple tags separated by commas or by selecting from presented options.

### Managing Tags:
- Tags are managed globally and can be reused across collections.
- Consider using consistent tag naming conventions to avoid duplicates (e.g., singular vs plural).

## 6. Organizing Strategy for Effective Retrieval

### Hierarchy + Tagging Workflow
- Create a **folder-like structure** with collections and sub-collections that represent broad categories or projects.
- Use **tags** as metadata layers enabling cross-category retrieval.

### Examples
- Collection: "Marketing Campaigns"
  - Sub-collection: "2024 Q2"
  - Tags on links: "email", "strategy", "analytics"

- Collection: "Personal"
  - Tags: "read-later", "recipes", "travel"

### Search and Filter
- Use collection-based filters to narrow down by project or area.
- Use tags to perform thematic or status-based searches.

## 7. Step-by-Step Instructions: Editing Links to Manage Collections and Tags

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Link Editor">
Open the link details or editing pane for the link you want to organize.
</Step>
<Step title="Assign or Change Collection">
Select or change the collection by choosing from the folder/tree list. To create a new collection, use the shortcut available in the selection interface.
</Step>
<Step title="Add Description">
Write or update the description field with notes or contextual info.
</Step>
<Step title="Add Tags">
Type and select existing tags or create new ones. You can assign multiple tags to describe the link comprehensively.
</Step>
<Step title="Save Updates">
Hit the Save button to apply changes. Your link now belongs to the chosen collection with the assigned tags and description.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 8. Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Use descriptive collection names**: Clear names reduce confusion.
- **Use sub-collections sparingly**: Keep hierarchy at 2-3 levels deep to avoid complexity.
- **Tag consistently**: Define common tags and avoid variations.
- **Add descriptions where helpful**: This pays off when searching later.
- **Review collections periodically**: Archive or consolidate rarely used collections.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Cannot find a collection when assigning a link
- Verify that your account is authenticated.
- Refresh collections list to sync new collections.
- Check if the collection is archived or deleted.

### Problem: Tags don’t seem to apply or save
- Ensure you have the required permissions to edit tags.
- Avoid special characters in tag names.
- Refresh and retry, as some UI latency can delay tag updates.

### Problem: Collections do not appear in expected hierarchy
- Confirm the parent collection assignment is saved correctly.
- Refresh the page to reload latest collection structure.

<Tip>
In case of unexpected behavior, logging out and back in or clearing app cache often resolves sync issues.
</Tip>
