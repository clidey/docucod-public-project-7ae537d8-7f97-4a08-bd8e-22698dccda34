# Sharing Collections or Links Publicly

This guide empowers you to safely make your collections or preserved links publicly accessible in Linkwarden. You'll learn how to publish curated resources via public URLs, understand link privacy implications, and navigate the nuances and best practices for public sharing.

## 1. Understanding Public Sharing in Linkwarden

### What Does It Mean to Share Publicly?
Sharing a collection or individual link publicly means creating a URL accessible without authentication. This public link serves as a read-only window for anyone you share it with, enabling broad distribution without requiring users to sign in.

### Why Use Public Sharing?
- **Collaborate with external audiences:** Share curated bookmarks with clients, communities, or teams without adding them to Linkwarden.
- **Publish resources:** Make collections available on websites or social platforms.
- **Preserve access:** Provide permanent, preserved versions of web content to users without requiring accounts.

### Key Privacy Considerations
- Public URLs bypass sign-in and access control. Treat these links as inherently exposed.
- Do not share sensitive or private information publicly.
- Public collections or links cannot be edited by anonymous users.

<Tip>
Public sharing is designed to maximize accessibility while maintaining your control over editing permissions and internal content management.

## 2. How to Make Collections Public

Sharing a collection publicly allows anyone with the public URL to view all bookmarks within that collection.

### Steps to Enable Public Collection Sharing:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Your Collection">
Navigate to the collection you want to share from your Linkwarden dashboard.
</Step>
<Step title="Find the Sharing Option">
Look for the sharing or privacy settings (usually found in the collection’s options or settings menu).
</Step>
<Step title="Enable Public Access">
Toggle or activate the public sharing option for that collection.
You will receive a public URL that you can copy and distribute.
</Step>
<Step title="Share the URL Carefully">
Distribute the public URL to your desired audience. Anyone with this link can view the collection contents.
</Step>
</Steps>

### What Publicly Shared Collection Users Can Do
- View preserved snapshots of links (screenshots, PDFs, reader views).
- Search and browse bookmarks within the collection.
- Follow active links to original pages.

### What They Cannot Do
- Edit, delete, or move links.
- See unshared collections or private bookmarks.
- Access internal features requiring authentication.

<Note>
Only collection owners and permitted collaborators can toggle public status or manage shared links.
</Note>

## 3. Sharing Individual Links Publicly

Sometimes you may want to share a specific preserved link publicly, without exposing the full collection.

### How to Share a Single Link Publicly:

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate the Link">
Find the desired link inside Linkwarden, either within one of your collections or via search.
</Step>
<Step title="Get Link Details">
Open the link’s detail view.
</Step>
<Step title="Generate Public URL">
If the system supports it, there will be an option like “Share Publicly” or “Get Public Link.” Select this to obtain the public URL.
</Step>
<Step title="Share the Public Link">
Copy and distribute this URL as needed.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Important Notes
- Public links inherit the preservation state, so shared readers or snapshots remain accessible.
- Public links do not allow editing or deletion by public users.

## 4. Managing Link Privacy and Public URL Mechanics

### Public URLs
- Are long, unguessable URLs generated by the system.
- Provide read-only access to the target collection or link.
- Are distinct from internal URLs that require user authentication.

### Changing Public Status
- To revoke public access, simply disable the public sharing option on the collection or link.
- The public URL will then become inaccessible.

### Caveats
- Public URLs could be indexed by search engines or shared beyond your intended audience.
- Avoid sharing publicly if the content is sensitive.

### Best Practices
- Regularly review which collections or links are shared publicly.
- Use descriptive collection names and descriptions to help public viewers understand the context.
- Keep sensitive bookmarks in private or secure collections.

<Tip>
Enable public sharing only for collections or links that truly benefit from broad access.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Public Sharing Issues

### Issue: Public Link Not Loading
- Confirm that public sharing is enabled for the collection/link.
- Verify you are using the correct public URL.
- Check internet connectivity and confirm the hosted instance is accessible.

### Issue: Unauthorized Access Errors
- Public sharing URLs bypass login, so if access is denied, ensure sharing is enabled properly.
- Make sure you are sharing the public URL, not an internal link.

### Tip
If you accidentally share sensitive content, immediately disable public access to revoke exposure.

## Appendix: Example Scenario

Imagine you are an educator creating a collection of web resources for a course. By enabling public sharing on this collection:

- Students receive a single public URL to access all course materials.
- You avoid tedious manual distribution by leveraging Linkwarden’s preservation and organization features.
- You ensure that students see up-to-date, preserved snapshots and don’t require Linkwarden accounts.

This public sharing workflow streamlines knowledge dissemination with simplicity and security.
